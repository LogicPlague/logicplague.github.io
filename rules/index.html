            <p>Always respect staff. Disrespecting our staff will result to you getting kicked. Possibly being banned.
            DDOSing of even the threat of doing so will get you automaticaly permanently BANNED on not just on your
            account, but also your IP. We will also have to you to the proper authorities. The same goes for DOXING!
            For our FiveM server, you may still play without a mic, but you can't apply for staff, or any
            departemnent. Traping other players will result in a writen warning, then a kick. Although, the writen
            warning only applys to new players with no reps. Cheaters/Hackers will be banned for a day. If you end up
            lagging a server, then you stuff will be removed, and a warning on a first attempt. Second actempt will
            retult in kick. You will be banned for a year if this appears to be intentional. Duel Claning is allowed,
            however, you are in a contradicting community, then we will abide by there duel clan rule and remove you if
            needed. Asking for staff will result in your applications to be not accepted and you will not be able to
            apply agean for a year. This will be marked on our roster and your application. Sending a report directly to
            a staff member will result to you being banned for three days.</p>
